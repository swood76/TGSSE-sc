# TGSSE-sc
Codebase for TGSSE-sc (Turret Gunnery Sensory Simulation Enviornment-Sensors and Communication). 
As of now the python code available on this repo brings the overall project to 0.9, in-built inference engine programmed on NVIDIA Jetson board publishes bounding box data in-real time based on subscribed image captures from the camera on the Hololens. This repo also supports code to enable the Jetson to perform real time object detection with the Jetson and the IMX219 Camera.
